# **FinAIty**

**AI-Agent Instant-Settlement & Hedged Payment Rail on Sei**

FinAIty is a decentralized network of autonomous AI agents that provide **instant, on-chain settlement** for B2B and merchant payments.
By dynamically **hedging and routing value** across on-chain liquidity, merchants receive stablecoins in **sub-second finality**, while AI agents manage short-term risk.
